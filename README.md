                   CivicAI

Quick start after cloning:

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run db:setup
npm run dev
```

The SQLite schema and demo users are created locally. Runtime database files,
SQLite WAL/SHM lock files, uploads, and `.env` secrets are not stored in Git, so
each developer gets a clean database without copying another machine's locks.
See `README.local.md` for demo accounts and SMTP setup.

 -> Making civic's problem reporting simpler, smarter, and more transparent..

 -> CivicAI is an AI-powered civic issue reporting and management platform
    designed to connect citizens with the concerned departments for solving
    problems in their communities.
  
 ->  Instead of simply collecting complaints, CivicAI helps turn citizen
    reports into structured and actionable information.

 -> A citizen can report an issue such as a pothole, overflowing garbage,
    broken streetlight, water leakage, or other civic problem using a photo,
    description, and location. AI then helps analyze the report, identify the
    issue, estimate its severity and priority, and suggest the appropriate
    department.

  -> Authorities can manage these reports through a dashboard, while citizens
    can follow the progress of their submitted issues.

  -> Why CivicAI?
     Civic problems are everywhere, but reporting them is often only the first
     step.
     
  -> Citizens may not know:
    - Where to report a problem
    - Which department is responsible
    - Whether their complaint was received
    - How serious their issue is compared with others
    - What is happening after they submit it

  -> At the same time, authorities may have to deal with a large number of
    reports and manually organize them.

   We wanted to explore a simple question:
  ->What if AI could help turn citizen complaints into useful, prioritized

   That idea became CivicAI.
